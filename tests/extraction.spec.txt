(Placeholder) Future test plan:

Test: naiveSentenceSplit
- Input: "The Earth has one moon. Quantum supremacy is achieved. This changes everything forever!"
- Expect: 3 sentences split correctly.

Test: deduplication
- Provide duplicate paragraphs -> expect unique sentences only.

Test: classification fallback
- Simulate API error -> expect neutral classification.
